QInterferenceSim

Overview-
QInterferenceSim is a simple simulation program to illustrate the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics through the double-slit experiment. It calculates and visualizes the interference pattern that emerges on a screen due to the superposition of waves passing through two slits.

Features-
Computes intensity patterns on a screen placed at a specified distance from the slits. Supports visualization either through a graphical plot (Python) or a text-based plot (C). Adjustable parameters such as wavelength, slit distance, screen distance, and number of points for simulation.

Acknowledgments-
Inspired by the principles of quantum mechanics and the classic double-slit experiment.
Built as a learning tool to understand wave-particle duality and interference phenomena.
